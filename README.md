# AutoML-Agent-System

## Overview
AutoML-Agent-System is an intelligent, agent-based framework designed to automate the machine learning workflow through natural language interactions. 

This system supports dynamic interactions via a Thought/Action/Observation (TAO) loop using Groqâ€™s integration with LLaMA. Through natural language prompts, users can load and preprocess datasets, train and evaluate various ML models, and optionally visualize results.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing:** Interact with the system using natural language to perform machine learning tasks.
- **Dynamic Workflow:** Uses the Thought/Action/Observation (TAO) loop for continuous interaction.
- **Dataset Handling:** Load, preprocess, and manage datasets for machine learning tasks.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Train and evaluate machine learning modelss.
- **Visualization:** Visualize results and performance metrics of models using Confusion Matrix and Bar Plots.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `groq`, `llama`, etc.
- Groq and LLaMA integration

## Installation
